# Zazi-CommunityNoticeApp
Android application to allow users to post updates about events or recommendations locally.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

People are looking for new methods to consume various types of media online, as access and
connectivity improve. It's become critical to be connected to everything and everyone. While
WhatsApp makes it simpler to connect with friends and family, there is a demand for something
that makes it easier to interact with strangers.

The goal of this application is to make it possible for Non-Profit Organisations, Fundraisers,
and the General Public to list events and other items on the app. We wanted to make it easier
for individuals to be aware of what's going on in their environment. The system functions as
an online platform via which you can communicate with your neighbors and community. It allows
users to easily share information such as crime reports, tradesman referrals, lost pets, local
services, and general news.
